Build server with maven2:
mvn clean && mvn assembly:assembly

Sometimes maven can't find JMX in its repository. In such case download it from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-java-plat-419418.html#7657-jmx-1.2.1-oth-JPR and install it in maven local repository. The jar files needed for the installation are in the 'lib' directory after unpacking.

===Installation on RPM based distributions of Linux===
The easiest way is to convert DEB package to RPM using alien:
alien -r package_name.deb

It will install but it won't start because the init script in init.d directory is prepared for Debian. One has to modify it or write new version just for RedHat/CentOS/etc...
